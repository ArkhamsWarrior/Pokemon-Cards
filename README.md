# Pokemon-Cards
This is my first attempt at doing some CSS hovering effects with shadows and translateX

It's pretty simple, a beginner project that I wanted to do on whim. 

I'm working to make it so the content in the cards reveals when you hover over them instead of simply having the cards do the lift effect on hover.

I also need to make it so all the cards are leveled prior to their hover. (The Shinx card is higher than Pikachu and Buizel card).
